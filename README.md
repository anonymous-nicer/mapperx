Adaptive Metadata Maintenance for Fast Crash Recovery of DM-Cache Based Hybrid Storage Devices

## Overview
This repository is for temporarily placing the MapperX project before publication. 
We design a novel extension to DM-cache that uses an on-disk adaptive bit-tree (ABT) to synchronously
maintain the metadata of dirty bits in a hierarchical manner.

Note: The key components of MapperX are temporarily not available until the paper is accepted, 
for hiding author info so as to satisfy the anonymity requirement.
